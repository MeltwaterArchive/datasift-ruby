DataSift
========

The official Ruby library for accessing the DataSift API. See
http://datasift.com/ for full details and to sign up for an account.

The examples use the username and API key in config.yml unless otherwise noted.

Install Instructions
--------------------

sudo gem install datasift

Dependencies
------------

If you're using the source you'll need to install the dependencies.

sudo gem install yajl-ruby rest-client

The library will use SSL connections by default. While we recommend using SSL
you may disable it if required by passing false as the third parameter when
creating a user, or by calling user.enableSSL(false) on the user object.

Simple example
--------------

This example looks for anything that contains the word "datasift" and simply
prints the content to the screen as they come in.

```ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'datasift'
user = DataSift::User.new("your username", "your api_key")
definition = user.createDefinition('interaction.content contains "football"')
consumer = definition.getConsumer(DataSift::StreamConsumer::TYPE_HTTP)
consumer.consume(true) do |interaction|
	if interaction
		puts interaction['interaction']['content']
	end
end
```

See the DataSift documentation for full details of the data contained within
each interaction. See this page on our developer site for an example tweet:

* v.1.2.0 Twitter Compliance (2012-02-28)

  The consumer now has an onDeleted method to which you can assign a block
  that will be called to handle DELETE requests from Twitter. See delete.rb
  in the examples folder for a sample implementation.
  (@see http://dev.datasift.com/docs/twitter-deletes)

  NB: if you are storing tweets you must implement this method in your code
  and take appropriate action to maintain compliance with the Twitter license.
